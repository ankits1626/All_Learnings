5th March

    Understand the problem statement
    had conversation with backend, QA and mobile folk

    Tools exploration in parllel
    Read books/papers

7th march
    Proceeded with iOS and XCUItest

12th March
    Problem statement: Confidence to deal with backend changes
    Shutdown XCUItest
    Appium Exploration
    explore various testing framework and tools
    how to raise a production ready automation framework

    build automation framework to showcase:
        1) verify available user points
        2) verify format of available user points
        3) verify data on reward category listing screen
        4) redemption of e-voucher
        5) redemption of physical reward
        6) reporting/evidence frames with high lighted problem area
        7) Customizable framework to test apps against different enviornments and datasource
        8) Reuse the same code base to test both ios and android

    Crucial Decisions:
        1) To begin with integrate the test suite with actual apis
        2) Use python appium client to build the test suite instead of java
        3) Use Page/Screen object model to organize the code
        4) Keep the test suite configurable: environment, user, excel-based test setup

    Questions/Risk:
        1) Api integrated test are fragile depending upon the availability
        2) Test environment needs a setup (need to explore the automation of this bit, working with QA to understand current process)

    Findings:
        1) We'll need an automation engineer for raise/maintain this

22nd March
    1) Catchup with Biplab
    2) Shakedown cases
    3) Regression
    4) Android / Configuration mock datasource

 3rd April:
    1) Screen object Model
    2) Android/iOS
    3) Scrolling gesture
